|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------|
| Tensors               | An n-dimensional array. Learn creation, data types, device management (CPU/GPU), and basic operations. | - Create tensors of different shapes and data types.<br>- Perform element-wise and matrix multiplication.<br>- Move tensors between CPU and GPU. | 2-4 hours     | Done         |
| Autograd              | PyTorch's automatic differentiation engine. Understand the computation graph, backpropagation, and how to get gradients. | - Build a simple linear model from scratch (no nn module).<br>- Write a forward pass.<br>- Manually trigger `loss.backward()` to compute gradients. | 3-5 hours     | In Progress  |
| nn.Module & optim     | The base class for all neural networks, and the package with various optimizers. Learn to subclass nn.Module to build a network and use an optimizer to train it. | - Implement a simple feed-forward neural network for binary classification.<br>- Define the model using nn.Module.<br>- Train it with an optimizer like Adam or SGD. | 5-8 hours     | Not Started  |
| DataLoaders & Datasets| Utilities for handling and loading data efficiently. Dataset holds your data, and DataLoader creates iterable batches. | - Create a custom Dataset for a simple CSV file or images.<br>- Use DataLoader to iterate over batches in a training loop.   | 3-5 hours     | Not Started  |
